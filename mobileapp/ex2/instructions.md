# Socket

You will be given a server that can be executed with python3
This server is going to send the base64 of a jpg in a socket for the host 127.0.0.1 on the port 10000

The only thing you know is that the 6 first bytes sent by the server are the size of the picture
Retrieve the whole jpg base64 from a client listening to the socket and write the picture in a file
